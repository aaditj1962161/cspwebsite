    <h1>   Project 1 - Turtle Run</h1>
      <img src="images/turtle.jpg">
      <p> This is my first project called Turtle Run. <br> In this game, the player has to answer simple questions to win the race against his opponent. <br> If the player
	  answers the question correctly, he  moves and the opponent stays still. The opposite happens when the player gets the answer wrong. <p>
      <br>

      <img src="images/PepperedMoth.PNG">
     <p> This is my fifth project called Peppered Moths. <br> This project simulates the population of different colored moths based on pollution. <br> As pollution increases, dark colored moth increase whereas the opposite happens when pollution decreases.</p>

    <h1> Project 6: Analyzing Rover Data.</h1>
      <img src="images/rocky.jpg">
     <p> By analyzing the given data, we were able to conclude the rover is in rocky mountains. <br> The graphs generated from the data match the trend of lower temperatures heating up quickly, low sound levels, and bright light sometimes interrupted by clouds.
     <br> We were a little confused between desert plains and rocky mountains but lower sound levels clearly indicated to rocky mountains. </p>
